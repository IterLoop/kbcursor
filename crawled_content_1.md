what is ai in supply chain authors what is ai in supply chain using artificial intelligence ai in supply chains can revolutionize the planning production management and optimization of supply chain activities

by processing vast amounts of data predicting trends and performing complex tasks in real time ai can improve supply chain decisionmaking and operational efficiency

recently this technology gained popularity as further advancements such as generative ai and tools such as chatbots have taken off and shown how beneficial the systems can be for supply chain management

meanwhile the covid pandemic illustrated just how fragile the global supply chain can be and why better management tools are necessary

a subset of ai is machine learning ml which is the process of a system taking in data sets and learning processes from them as opposed to being programmed with builtin instructions

ml can go far beyond what a traditional software can do

it can forecast customer demand discover patterns make market predictions interpret voice and written text and analyze a multitude of factors that can optimize a supply chains workflow

more use cases are emerging than ever before

while its important to embrace ai its also imperative to understand all the benefits and challenges that can come with it before introducing a new system into a supply chain

manufacturers and logistics providers should take the necessary steps to prepare their supply chains for ai systems and understand that an optimization of this magnitude can take time and resources

how does ai in supply chain work supply chain systems powered by ai are helping companies optimize routes streamline workflows improve procurement minimize shortages and automate tasks endtoend

a supply chain can become complicated especially for manufacturers of goods who oftentimes rely on their partners to ship their goods in a timely and organized fashion

ai can keep all parts of a supply chain in balance with its ability to find patterns and relationships unlike a traditional nonai system

these patterns can help optimize logistics networks all the way from the warehouse to cargo freighters to distribution centers

modern supply chains are expansive and require thorough oversight to avoid unnecessary disruptions

ai systems can offer assistance in forecasting such as demand planning or being able to predict production and warehouse capacity based on customer demand

some are using ai to gain insights from a broader data set collected from internet of things iot devices deployed across the supply chain

ai can also be used in supply chain operations for tracking inventory levels and market trends

in inventory management ai can enhance supply chain visibility automate documentation for physical goods and intelligently enter data whenever items change hands

it can help with transparency for the manufacturer and provide valuable data for all stakeholders in the supply chain

ais enhancement of supply chain transparency offers unmatched time and cost savings

it also helps companies meet ethical and sustainability standards which have historically been timeconsuming and expensive

benefits of ai in supply chains an aipowered supply chain has many potential benefits for building supply chain resilience and a stronger base for manufacturers

lower operating costs ai can learn and understand complex behaviors and can learn repetitive tasks such as tracking inventory and complete them quickly and accurately

ai solutions can reduce overall operating costs by identifying inefficiencies and mitigating bottlenecks

advanced realtime decisions ai uses historical and realtime data to make realtime decisions oftentimes with conversational answers

ai processes the data and can analyze the root of the problem and suggest a solution in that moment

cut down on errors and waste one of the benefits of ai technology is its ability to spot behaviors and patterns

by doing so manufacturers and warehouse operators can train algorithms to find flaws such as employee errors and product defects long before bigger mistakes are made

furthermore ai can help streamline an erp framework and can be directly embedded

more tailored inventory management as previously discussed ai can help forecast demand with its extensive use of inventory information

it can help manufacturers and supply chain managers gauge a customers interest in a product and determine whether a customers demand is rising or falling and adjust accordingly

it can aid in a manufacturers decisionmaking process and improve the accuracy of demand forecasting

improved warehouse efficiency ai specifically ml models helps lay out warehouses more efficiently by being able to evaluate the quantity of materials coming in and improve service levels

the ai system can also plan the optimal routes for machinery and for workers and be an overall warehouse management powerhouse

better supply chain sustainability by using the predictive analytics that ai offers companies are able to make supply chains more sustainable and better for the environment

manufacturers can use ai and ml models to optimize truckloads predict the most efficient delivery routes and reduce product waste in the marketplace

optimized operations through simulation supply chain managers are always looking to better understand their operation

with aipowered simulations theyre able to not only gain insight but also understand and find ways to improve

ai working alongside digital twins can visualize potential supply chain disruptions and visualize through d visual models external processes that might create unnecessary downtime

challenges of ai in supply chain ai implementation can be complicated and businesses should understand the challenges and risks of introducing this new technology

downtime for training anytime a company brings in a new technology they need to train the individuals who will be interacting with it at any level

due to this necessity downtime is likely to occur so its best to prepare and schedule accordingly to limit disruptions

all supply chain professionals should be aware of potential downtime and be transparent with partners that it might occur

startup costs there are several cost considerations in implementing ai

along with the cost of the software to run the system machine learning models are also an expense to consider

some come prebuilt or can be built from scratch if the company prefers that option

either way its important to train the model on your own clean historical data before inputting ai algorithms

complex systems the work doesnt stop as soon as the ai has been implemented

an ai system at a global scale is complex and requires supply chain planners to constantly stay on top of how the tools are performing and finetune as needed

ai risks there are three common risks when integrating ai in supply chains inaccuracy of data ai is built and generated from large amounts of data found from a range of sources

due to the nature of the origin of the data inaccuracies and bias might be present which would result in the spread of misinformation

for that reason ai requires human review to ensure that the data is fair unbiased and explainable

overreliance on ai human interaction should be the superior solution and the key expert in managing and handling supply chain risks

ai is a tool it cannot build relationships

there is a misconception that ai can replace human intelligence but in fact ai should augment it

furthermore if the technology fails humans with expertise must keep the supply chain running

security and privacy vulnerabilities the increased collection and use of customer data for ai models also increases the risks of surveillance hacking and cyberattacks

businesses must prioritize and safeguard consumers privacy and data rights providing explicit assurances about how data is used and protected

steps to prepare a supply chain for ai before a business implements an ai solution it must prepare its legacy supply chain planning and management system

take stock of current logistics network see what is and what isnt working for your business

take stock of the bottlenecks or areas where constant issues arise to ensure that the ai technology is benefiting you in the best way possible

what you can do identify pain points within the supply chain from end to end

clean data to determine how structured and unstructured data should be used

make a roadmap decide which issues your business wants to address first and which ones are less of a necessity

its likely there are going to be multiple issues for a supply chain so prioritization is key

what you can do prioritize issues based on what your supply chain needs

take on the more difficult pressing issues first and then delineate between the medium to lower importance

design and select a solution there are several types of systems to choose from and which one a business selects will depend on its needs and the roadmap it has developed

at this point a business might bring in a consultant or industry expert for guidance

what you can do go through each system option to see which best fits the companys supply chain management goals

consider gaining professional insight from an industry expert

begin to implement the business needs to begin implementation of the ai technology at this point

the system integrator is likely going to be working with the internal it team and the ai solution vendor to get things up and running

what you can do prepare and educate a team on the ai technology

be ready for setbacks or errors to occur in the process

prepare employees ai technology can be a major change that requires training patience and a plan

employees need to learn how to do their jobs and open communication is key to successful ai technology implementation

what you can do make a plan for communication to all employees before implementation begins

consider the downtime that it takes to train employees and create a schedule

continue to monitor ai technology is always changing improving and adjusting

the teams who must manage the technology need to test and track what happens when adjustments occur so that periodic refinements can be made

what you can do regularly test the ai solution and troubleshoot its capabilities

ensure that there is an organized tracking method for when testing occurs

putting ai to work for your supply chain learn how to transform your supply chain workflows with the help of ai
