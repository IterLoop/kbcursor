I cover logistics and supply chain management. Following Oct 7, 2024, 05:58pm EDT Updated Oct 9, 2024, 08:32am EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin AI in the Supply Chain getty When it came out, ChatGPT seemed like magic. It has led supply chain vendors to discuss how they currently use artificial intelligence. Further, virtually every supplier of supply chain solutions is eager to explain the ongoing investments they are making in artificial intelligence. Any device that can perceive its environment and can take actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal is engaged in some form of artificial intelligence. AI is not a new technology in the supply chain realm; it has been used in some cases for decades. More recently, many other cases have emerged. Optimization is used in supply planning, factory scheduling, supply chain design , and transportation planning . In a broad sense, optimization refers to creating plans that help companies achieve service levels and other goals at the lowest cost. In mathematical terms, optimization is a mixed-integer or linear programming approach to finding the best combination of warehouses, factories, transportation flows, and other supply chain resources under real-world constraints. Machine Learning occurs when a machine takes the output, observes its accuracy, and updates its model so that better outputs will occur . Demand planning engines have natural feedback loops that allow the forecast engine to learn. The forecast can be compared to what actually shipped or sold. Since ML began being used in demand forecasting in the early 2000s, ML has helped greatly increase the breadth and depth of forecasting. Now, ML forecasting is not just monthly or quarterly; weekly and even daily forecasting is now possible. We have moved from product-level forecasts at a regional level to stock-keeping unit forecasts made at the store level . More recently, demand planning applications based on machine learning have improved forecasting by incorporating competitor pricing data, store traffic, and weather data . MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor We are no longer just forecasting demand but also when trucks and factory machinery are likely to break down ( predictive maintenance ), the optimal amount of inventory to hold and where it should be held ( inventory optimization) , and labor forecasting in the warehouse . This type of forecasting can forecast the number of employees required to perform estimated work down to the day, shift, job, and zone level. ML can also be used to generate labor standards for warehouse workers . ML techniques like clustering, data similarity, and semantic tagging can automate master data management . Without accurate data, companies face the garbage in, garbage out problem. In terms of supply planning, if key parameters (like supplier lead times) are no longer correct, then the planning becomes suboptimal. ML is being used to keep key parameters and policies up to date . It is also being used to predict whether an SKU believed to be in stock at a store is actually out of stock . Supply chain risk solutions use ML and other forms of AI to predict which suppliers are included in a company\u2019s multi-tier supply chain . This is becoming increasingly necessary as customs will hold up shipments at the port if it believes the shipment contains products made with slave labor from China. This is true even if those components came from their supplier\u2019s supplier\u2019s supplier and represent a minuscule portion of the total cost of the product. Shippers' end-to-end supply chain predictions are based on applying AI to OpenWeb searches, import/export records, data from sourcing platforms like ThomasNet, federal logistics records, and other data. These predictions accelerate a company\u2019s ability to verify how its extended supply chain is constructed. Customs uses the same technology to determine which shipments should be denied entry. Natural Language Processing is used to classify commodity classification for use in imports and exports and in real-time supply chain risk solutions . The Harmonized System is a commodity classification coding taxonomy that forms the basis upon which all goods are identified for customs. It is used by customs authorities worldwide. Using the right product classification allows companies to pay the correct tariffs. Paying the right tariffs is necessary to avoid government fines and calculate the true landed cost of products. The problem is that there is an incredible gap between how products are described commercially and how they are expressed in the national customs tariff schedules. This has resulted in error rates as high as 30%. The combination of natural language processing and expert systems has been used to automate and significantly improve the classification process. Real-time risk solutions also use natural language processing to read online publications and other data sources, make sense of what they read, contextualize the data into information, and report supply chain disruptions caused by weather, geopolitical events, and other hazards in near real-time. Every step in that value chain has search terms associated with it. The names of the suppliers, carriers, logistics service providers become search terms. Those search terms are paired with terms signaling a problem \u2013 those terms might be \u201cbankruptcy,\u201d \u201cplant fire,\u201d \u201cport explosion,\u201d \u201cstrike\u201d, and many, many other terms. So, the term \u201cHaiphong\u201d when combined in an article with the phrase \u201cport fire\u201d would generate an alert. Reinforcement Learning is a form of machine learning that lets AI models refine their decision-making process based on positive, neutral, and negative feedback. For example, if you want to train a vision system to recognize a dog's image, you will start by using humans to look at tens of thousands of images of animals. The humans label the pictures as dog, not dog, or unclear. The computer is then presented with those images. The system would say, \u201cthis is a dog\u201d or \u201cthis is not a dog\u201d and it learns whether its conclusion was correct. Drones use this form of AI to improve inventory accuracy in a warehouse . Reinforcement learning allows the drone to recognize warehouse racks, pallets, and cases and get close enough to inventory to scan the barcodes. Similarly, reinforcement learning has been applied to security camera footage in the warehouse to ensure workers are following standard operating procedures . Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) allows a vehicle to construct and update a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of the vehicle\u2019s location within it. This technology allows mobile robots to move autonomously through a warehouse. Drones and autonomous mobile robots using SLAM are in an early adoption stage for last-mile deliveries . Autonomous trucks a lso use SLAM . These trucks when feasible, will revolutionize logistics. But we are probably just a couple of years out from being able to transport goods from a distribution center to a retail facility autonomously. Check out my website .

January 3, 2025 Brent Hasenkamp o9 Solutions issaronow/stock.adobe.com Over the past five years, businesses  across the manufacturing industry have dealt with numerous supply chain  disruptions that have impacted their ability to maintain customer service  levels, optimize working capital and have led to significant reactionary COGS  through expedited freight, purchase orders and overtime. The dynamics have  forced many to rethink their pre-pandemic inventory and supply chain planning  strategies. Additionally, the increasing number of supply chain events has  created an environment where companies responded by increasing inventory levels  as a buffer to hedge against the effects of supply chain disruptions but led to  vulnerability to excess and obsolete inventory as demand patterns have also  been changing with increased frequency. Companies have turned to AI-enabled  platforms to help navigate a business and economic environment marked by  volatility, uncertainty, ambiguity, and complexity (VUCA). As we head into  2025, companies are likely to leverage AI technologies to help transition back  towards their pre-pandemic operating levels and focus on building greater  agility and flexibility into their supply chains. Here are three potential use  cases for using AI to hedge against uncertainty in the coming year. Enhanced Scenario Planning Capabilities More organizations are using AI technology to inform their short-term, mid-term  and long-term supply chain planning capabilities, however, many are still  somewhat rudimentary in how they execute their day-to-day tasks. In order to  quickly identify and respond proactively to potential supply chain disruptions  in 2025, companies need to fully optimize their scenario planning capabilities  and should consider integrating their spreadsheet data into their planning  platform. AI-enabled planning platforms are able to  collect a company\u2019s historical data and other relevant internal and external  data points, then provide structured insights and map out actions that can  inform real-time planning decisions. Advanced planning capabilities like  control towers or digital twins enable planning teams to simulate potential  outcomes, compare financial implications, etc., and present actionable  recommendations to stakeholders and leadership when necessary. As GenAI  continues to be applied in planning practices, companies will be able to ask  specific queries, and the platform will be able to gather data insights to help  identify potential trends, challenges, and opportunities during the scenario  planning process. For example, a use case that is emerging is companies  leveraging AI to identify trends, such as over-forecasting by customers or  underperformance in suppliers, allowing companies to address and correct the  issue. While we can\u2019t determine all of the factors that could influence potential  supply chain disruptions in the coming year, companies that are able to utilize  AI platforms that enable early disruption detection and enact data-driven  planning strategies and proactive decision-making will be better positioned to  strengthen their supply chain. Touchless  Planning The future of planning is powered by  advanced AI engines, reducing manual intervention, and boosting efficiency with  Touchless Planning. But, without trust, planners spend too much time touching  system outputs and end up making the wrong decisions. It\u2019s critical to ensure  the following components are in place to drive effective touchless planning  including: High-fidelity Input Data: Planning systems require complete, rich, and accurate data as input, both       historical and future oriented. Right       Granularity: Data must offer precise       information across various dimensions (e.g., time, market, product and\u00a0product life cycle) Advanced AI       Engine: AI algorithms must be able to       handle complex data sets, identify patterns, deal with outliers, and learn       over time to improve accuracy. High-accuracy       Results: The output should be accurate,       unbiased, reliable (avoids big outliers), and stable (low variations from       one forecast to the next). Explainable       Forecast: Explainability refers to a       system\u2019s ability to offer clear and understandable justifications for how       it reached a particular decision. Feedback Mechanisms: Systems need       to provide helpful feedback with detailed insights into how adjustments       affect forecasting accuracy and forecast value add. Organizations are increasingly looking to  automate activities across demand and supply planning and enabling these  capabilities provide critical, differentiated capabilities for manufacturing  organizations. Closing  the Skills Gap Another area where AI applications can be applied is supply chain talent and  skills development. A critical challenge is addressing the supply chain  planning skills gap and also aligning skilled talent with new technologies.  Incoming talent may need to strengthen their on-the-job planning skill sets,  and existing personnel may need to adapt to newer ways of working and acquire  new skills related to AI and other emerging technologies. However, many  companies still operate with outdated systems, so it is also necessary for  companies to adopt advanced technologies to strengthen their supply chain  management capabilities to tackle future challenges and disruptions that could  impact their business. Another area where AI-enabled platforms can help bridge  the skills gap between incoming talent and employees who will be retiring in  the near future is by enabling the digitization of tribal information so that  newer employees can be \u201ctrained\u201d based on the internal knowledge of more  experienced employees. For example, if a newer planner experiences a disruption  that is similar to a situation that more experienced planners had experienced  previously, the platform has this data built into its recommended insights and  a newer planner is able to use this information to guide their decision-making.  Organizations that make investments to integrate digital tools and technologies  to operate more efficiently and strengthen their supply chains against  disruptions will build a greater competitive advantage going forward. While we can\u2019t predict what supply chain  disruptions may crop up in the coming year, AI-enabled platforms and  technologies allow companies to identify potential risks impacting their supply  chain, bolster the skillset of their workforce, and find opportunities to  collaborate and strengthen relationships with their suppliers, all of which can  lead to greater supply chain resiliency.

  "body_text": "START OF BODY TEXT As we head into 2025, companies are likely to leverage AI technologies to help transition back towards their pre-pandemic operating levels and focus on building greater agility and flexibility into their supply chains. Over the past five years, businesses across the manufacturing industry have dealt with numerous supply chain disruptions that have impacted their ability to maintain customer service levels, optimize working capital and have led to significant reactionary COGS through expedited freight, purchase orders and overtime. The dynamics have forced many to rethink their pre-pandemic inventory and supply chain planning strategies. Additionally, the increasing number of supply chain events has created an environment where companies responded by increasing inventory levels as a buffer to hedge against the effects of supply chain disruptions but led to vulnerability to excess and obsolete inventory as demand patterns have also been changing with increased frequency. Companies have turned to AI-enabled platforms to help navigate a business and economic environment marked by volatility, uncertainty, ambiguity, and complexity (VUCA). As we head into 2025, companies are likely to leverage AI technologies to help transition back towards their pre-pandemic operating levels and focus on building greater agility and flexibility into their supply chains. Here are three potential use cases for using AI to hedge against uncertainty in the coming year. Enhanced Scenario Planning Capabilities More organizations are using AI technology to inform their short-term, mid-term and long-term supply chain planning capabilities, however, many are still somewhat rudimentary in how they execute their day-to-day tasks. In order to quickly identify and respond proactively to potential supply chain disruptions in 2025, companies need to fully optimize their scenario planning capabilities and should consider integrating their spreadsheet data into their planning platform. AI-enabled planning platforms are able to collect a company\u2019s historical data and other relevant internal and external data points, then provide structured insights and map out actions that can inform real-time planning decisions. Advanced planning capabilities like control towers or digital twins enable planning teams to simulate potential outcomes, compare financial implications, etc., and present actionable recommendations to stakeholders and leadership when necessary. As GenAI continues to be applied in planning practices, companies will be able to ask specific queries, and the platform will be able to gather data insights to help identify potential trends, challenges, and opportunities during the scenario planning process. For example, a use case that is emerging is companies leveraging AI to identify trends, such as over-forecasting by customers or underperformance in suppliers, allowing companies to address and correct the issue. While we can\u2019t determine all of the factors that could influence potential supply chain disruptions in the coming year, companies that are able to utilize AI platforms that enable early disruption detection and enact data-driven planning strategies and proactive decision-making will be better positioned to strengthen their supply chain. Touchless Planning The future of planning is powered by advanced AI engines, reducing manual intervention, and boosting efficiency with Touchless Planning. But, without trust, planners spend too much time touching system outputs and end up making the wrong decisions. It\u2019s critical to ensure the following components are in place to drive effective touchless planning including: High-fidelity Input Data: Planning systems require complete, rich, and accurate data as input, both historical and future oriented. Right Granularity: Data must offer precise information across various dimensions (e.g., time, market, product and product life cycle) Advanced AI Engine: AI algorithms must be able to handle complex data sets, identify patterns, deal with outliers, and learn over time to improve accuracy. High-accuracy Results: The output should be accurate, unbiased, reliable (avoids big outliers), and stable (low variations from one forecast to the next). Explainable Forecast: Explainability refers to a system\u2019s ability to offer clear and understandable justifications for how it reached a particular decision. Feedback Mechanisms: Systems need to provide helpful feedback with detailed insights into how adjustments affect forecasting accuracy and forecast value add. Organizations are increasingly looking to automate activities across demand and supply planning and enabling these capabilities provide critical, differentiated capabilities for manufacturing organizations. Closing the Skills Gap Another area where AI applications can be applied is supply chain talent and skills development. A critical challenge is addressing the supply chain planning skills gap and also aligning skilled talent with new technologies. Incoming talent may need to strengthen their on-the-job planning skill sets, and existing personnel may need to adapt to newer ways of working and acquire new skills related to AI and other emerging technologies. However, many companies still operate with outdated systems, so it is also necessary for companies to adopt advanced technologies to strengthen their supply chain management capabilities to tackle future challenges and disruptions that could impact their business. Another area where AI-enabled platforms can help bridge the skills gap between incoming talent and employees who will be retiring in the near future is by enabling the digitization of tribal information so that newer employees can be \u201ctrained\u201d based on the internal knowledge of more experienced employees. For example, if a newer planner experiences a disruption that is similar to a situation that more experienced planners had experienced previously, the platform has this data built into its recommended insights and a newer planner is able to use this information to guide their decision-making. Organizations that make investments to integrate digital tools and technologies to operate more efficiently and strengthen their supply chains against disruptions will build a greater competitive advantage going forward. While we can\u2019t predict what supply chain disruptions may crop up in the coming year, AI-enabled platforms and technologies allow companies to identify potential risks impacting their supply chain, bolster the skillset of their workforce, and find opportunities to collaborate and strengthen relationships with their suppliers, all of which can lead to greater supply chain resiliency.
